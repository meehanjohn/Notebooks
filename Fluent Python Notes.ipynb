    "Special methods are meant to be called by the Python interpreter, and not by you. You don't write `my_object.__len__()`. You write `len(my_object)` and, if `my_object` is an instance of a user-defined class, then Python calls the `__len__` instance method you implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for built-in types like `list`, `str`, `bytearray`, and so on, the interpreter takes a shortcut: the CPython implementation of `len()` actually returns the value of the `ob_size` field in the `PyVarObject` C struct that represents any variable-sized built-in object in memory. This is much faster than calling a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not, the special method call is implicit. `for i in x:` actually causes the invocation of `iter(x)`, which in turn may call `x.__iter__()` if that is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should not typically have many direct calls to special methods. Unless you are doing a lot of metaprogramming, you should be implementing special methods more often that invoking them explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only special method that is frequently called by user code directly is `__init__`, to invoke the initializer of the superclass in your own `__init__` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to invoke a special method, it is usualy better to call the related built-in function (e.g., len, iter, str, etc). These built-ins call the corresponding special method, but often provide other services, and - for built-in types - are faster than method calls.\n",
    "\n",

The `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` special methods that handle the `[]` operator simply receive the indices in `a[i, j]` as a tuple. In other words, to evaluate `a[i, j]`, Python calls `a.__getitem__((i, j))`.\n",

As such, it can be passed as an argument to functions and as part of a slice specification, as in `f(a, ..., z)` or `a[i:...]`.

In the case of mutable sequences (e.g., `list`, `bytearray`, `array.array`), `a` will be changed in place (i.e., the effect will be similar to `a.extend(b)`). However, when `a` does not implement `__iadd__`, the expression `a += b` has the same effect as `a = a + b`: the expression `a + b` is evaluated first, producing a new object, which is then bound to `a`. In other words, the identity of the object bound to `a` may or may not change, depending on the availability of `__iadd__`.\n",

This is an important Python API convention: functions or methods that change an object in place should return `None` to make it clear to the caller that the object itself was changed, and no new object was created. The same behavior can be seen, for example, in the `random.shuffle` function.\n",

See Wikipedia's \"Fluent interface\" entry for further description of this topic.\n",

    "### Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering the standard library sequence types is a prerequisite for writing concise, effective, and idiomatic Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python sequences are often categorized as mutable or immutable, but it is also useful to consider a different axis: flat sequences or container sequences. The former are more compact, faster, and easier to use, but are limited to storing atomic data such as numbers, characters, and bytes. Container sequences are more flexible, but may surprise you when they hold mutable objects, so you need to be careful to use them correctly with nested data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions and generator expressions are powerful notations to build and initialize sequences. If you are not yet comfortable with them, take the time to master their basic usage. It is not hard, and soon you will be hooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples in Python play two roles: as records with unnamed fields and as immutable lists. When a tuple is used as a record, tuple unpacking is the safest, most readable way of getting at the fields. The new `*` syntax makes tuple unpacking even better by making it easier to ignore some fields and to deal with optional fields. Named tuples are not so new, but deserve more attention: like tuples, they have very little overhead per instance, yet provide convenient access to the fields by name and a handy `._asdict()` to export the record as an `OrderedDict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence slicing is a favorite Python syntax feature, and it is even more powerful than many realize. Multidimensional slicing and ellipsis (...) notation, as used in NumPy, may also be supported by user-defined sequences. Assigning to slices is a very expressive way of editing mutable sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated concatenation as in `seq * n` is convenient and, with care, can be used to initialize lists of lists containing immutable items. Augmented assignment with `+=` and `*=` behaves differently for mutable and immutable sequences. In the latter case, these operators necessarily build new sequences. But if the target sequence is mutable, it is usually changed in place = but not always, depending on how the sequence is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sort` method and the `sorted` built-in function are easy to use and flexible, thanks to the `key` optional arugment they accept, with a function to calculate the ordering criterion. By the way, `key` can be used with the `min` and `max` built-in functions. To keep a sorted sequence in order, always insert items into it using `bisect.insort`; to search it efficiently, use `bisect.bisect`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond lists and tuples, the Python standard library provides `array.array`. Although NumPy and SciPy are not part of the standard library, if you do any kind of numerical processing on large sets of data, studying even a small part of these libraries can take you a long way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We closed by visiting the versatile and thread-safe `collections.deque`, comparing its API with that of `list` in Table 2-3 and mentioning other queue implementations in the standard library."
