    "Special methods are meant to be called by the Python interpreter, and not by you. You don't write `my_object.__len__()`. You write `len(my_object)` and, if `my_object` is an instance of a user-defined class, then Python calls the `__len__` instance method you implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for built-in types like `list`, `str`, `bytearray`, and so on, the interpreter takes a shortcut: the CPython implementation of `len()` actually returns the value of the `ob_size` field in the `PyVarObject` C struct that represents any variable-sized built-in object in memory. This is much faster than calling a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not, the special method call is implicit. `for i in x:` actually causes the invocation of `iter(x)`, which in turn may call `x.__iter__()` if that is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should not typically have many direct calls to special methods. Unless you are doing a lot of metaprogramming, you should be implementing special methods more often that invoking them explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only special method that is frequently called by user code directly is `__init__`, to invoke the initializer of the superclass in your own `__init__` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to invoke a special method, it is usualy better to call the related built-in function (e.g., len, iter, str, etc). These built-ins call the corresponding special method, but often provide other services, and - for built-in types - are faster than method calls.\n",
    "\n",
