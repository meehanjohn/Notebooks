    "I have chosen to analyze the [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer). The database includes approximately 26,000 records of soccer matches, including team layout and game outcome. There is also data regarding player and team attributes (taken from the FIFA video games), and values for betting odds on each game across several online gambling platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "My focus will be on the players making up each team, team formations, and their respective impacts on team performance. Through this project, I will attempt to draw conclusions about factors influencing team performance based on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this database and to focus on performance because of the connection with my work background. I am interested in improving the performance of a manufacturing organization which produces only custom made-to-order products. I would like to draw a parallel between analyzing team sport performance and team business performance."
